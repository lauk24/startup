Forgot to actually make a copy of the startup file on GitHub so succesfully made a copy.
Had errors actually pushing to GitHub so had to make a SHH key.
Did not realize that when deploying, it deployed to a subdomain, but eventually was able to deploy the new files succesfully
Need to research more into when to use headings, paragraphs, or span. Just unsure what's possible with or exactly how to use CSS and JavaScript
